# ActionHub Shopify App

The ActionHub Shopify App helps merchants by generating customer product recommendations and tag-based segments for use in Shopify sales and marketing channels. Merchants will see improved effectiveness in marketing campaigns when using these recommendations and segments.

## Release Targets

### v1 (MVP) 

- Allow merchant to integrate growth segments with Shopify marketing channels

### v2 (If-it-works)

- Allow merchants to make personalized recomendations via an in-store ActionHub widget

## Note

This app needs access to orders older than 60 days so that the full relationship of products ordered over time can be included in the models that generate recommendations. The accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations are significantly improved by considering things like year-over-year seasonal trends for cohorts of customers.
